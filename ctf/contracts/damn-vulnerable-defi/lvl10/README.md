# Challenge #10 - Free Rider

A new marketplace of Damn Valuable NFTs has been released! There’s been an initial mint of 6 NFTs, which are available for sale in the marketplace. Each one at 15 ETH.

The developers behind it have been notified the marketplace is vulnerable. All tokens can be taken. Yet they have absolutely no idea how to do it. So they’re offering a bounty of 45 ETH for whoever is willing to take the NFTs out and send them their way.

You’ve agreed to help. Although, you only have 0.1 ETH in balance. The devs just won’t reply to your messages asking for more.

If only you could get free ETH, at least for an instant.
